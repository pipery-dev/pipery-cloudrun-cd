# Pipery Cloud Run CD

CD pipeline for Google Cloud Run: push image → gcloud run deploy → traffic migration and health check

## Status

- Owner: `pipery-dev`
- Repository: `pipery-cloudrun-cd`
- Marketplace category: `continuous-integration`
- Current version: `3.0.0`

## Usage

```yaml
name: Example
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pipery-dev/pipery-cloudrun-cd@v3
        with:
          project_path: .
          config_file: .pipery/config.yaml
          image_name: 
          image_tag: ${{ github.sha }}
          service_name: 
          region: us-central1
          project_id: 
          platform: managed
          traffic: 100
          min_instances: 0
          max_instances: 100
          concurrency: 80
          skip_push: false
          skip_deploy: false
          skip_status_check: false
          log_file: pipery.jsonl
```

## GitLab CI

This repository also includes a GitLab CI equivalent at `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Copy it into a GitLab project or use it as the reference implementation when you want to run the same Pipery pipeline outside GitHub Actions.

The GitLab pipeline maps the action inputs to CI/CD variables, publishes `pipery.jsonl` as an artifact, and keeps the same skip controls where the GitHub Action exposes them. Store credentials such as deploy tokens, registry passwords, and cloud provider keys as protected GitLab CI/CD variables.

```yaml
include:
  - remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipery-dev/pipery-cloudrun-cd/v3/.gitlab-ci.yml
```

## Development

This repository is managed with `pipery-tooling`.

```bash
pipery-actions test --repo .
pipery-actions docs --repo .
pipery-actions release --repo . --dry-run
```

By default, `pipery-actions test --repo .` executes the action against `test-project` and validates `pipery.jsonl`.

## Marketplace Release Flow

1. Update the implementation and changelog.
2. Run `pipery-actions release --repo .`.
3. Push the created git tag and major tag alias.
4. Publish the GitHub release.
